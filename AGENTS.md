- be concise
- don't use fancy unicode or too many emoji characters
- use test driven development where it makes sense. It doesn't make sense to do this when streamlit's caching becomes a problem.
- the project is managed with poetry
- for a new piece of work, check out a new branch, then groups file changes logically and give them appropriate commit messages, then submit for a PR
- make sure you document changes in the CHANGELOG.md in a concise manner
- follow semver best practices for versioning
- for every PR you do, check the README.md file and any other documentation to verify if they need updating
- Don't just add to a documentation file, feel free to rewrite things or collapse sections if it leads to a more concise summary.
