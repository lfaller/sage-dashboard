## SAGE - Sex-Aware Genomics Explorer

### The Problem

Sex differences impact ~12.5% of human gene expression, yet:

* Over 25% of critical metadata is missing from public genomics studies
* ~70% of studies claiming sex differences never actually test them statistically
* Failure to stratify by sex conceals up to 22% of significant expression differences
* Women experience adverse drug reactions nearly twice as often as men—partly due to this data gap

### The Solution

A free, open-source dashboard that:

* Assesses metadata completeness for sex across GEO/SRA datasets
* Identifies datasets where sex can be computationally inferred from expression data
* Prioritizes opportunities for reanalysis by disease relevance and clinical impact
* Tracks progress over time to measure community improvement
